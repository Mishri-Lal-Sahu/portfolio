            <h3 className="text-lg">Frontend Development</h3>
            <p>
              Frontend development, also known as client-side development,
              focuses on the part of a website that users interact with
              directly. It involves designing and building the user interface of
              a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML (HyperText Markup
              Language) serves as the foundation for creating the structure of
              web pages, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and
              format the visual elements. JavaScript adds interactivity and
              dynamic behavior to the website, making it more engaging and
              responsive.
